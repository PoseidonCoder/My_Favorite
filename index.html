        According to their
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots"
          >wikipedia page</a
        >, "Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne
        piløts) is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. Initially a
        band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along
        with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their
        departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The
        duo is best known for their singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and
        "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group
        Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The
        band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and
        Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by
        Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and
        became the second album in history on which every track received at
        least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in
        the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or
        platinum awards.[1] The duo achieved breakthrough success with their
        fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles
        "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album on which every
        track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry
        Association of America.[2][3] The release of the single "Heathens" also
        made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two
        concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock
        act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five
        of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.[4] The
        duo has released six studio albums in total, with the latest being
        Scaled and Icy, released on May 21, 2021. They have also garnered ten
        No. 1 songs on the Alternative Songs chart, making them the artist with
        the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart, just below Linkin
        Park.[5]
